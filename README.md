# ngrx-facades
This is the sample code for the Auth0 tutorial [NgRx Facades: Pros and Cons](http://www.auth0.com/blog/ngrx-facades).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5 but updated to 7.1.3 using `ng update`.

To learn how to add authentication to this project, check out our [NgRx Authentication Tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/ngrx-authentication-tutorial/).

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo, install the dependencies, and check out the "Starting point" commit to follow along with the tutorial.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auth0-blog/ngrx-facades.git
cd ngrx-facades
npm install
git checkout 8e24360
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`, as well as the NgRx schematics like `feature` or `reducer`.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
